This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a controller for a simple parking system. The system uses a Moore Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage the flow, including password-protected entry and visual indicators for different states.

‚öôÔ∏è Module Functionality
The parking_system module controls the logic for a basic parking garage entrance. Key functionalities include:

Entry Trigger: A car approaching the entrance triggers the system via sensor_entrance.

Password Verification: The system enters a waiting period for a two-part password (password_1, password_2) to be entered.

Access Control: Access is granted only upon entering the correct password (hardcoded as password_1 = 2 
‚Ä≤
 b01 and password_2 = 2 
‚Ä≤
 b10).

Exit Detection: An exit sensor (sensor_exit) is used to detect a car leaving, returning the system to an idle state.

Visual Feedback: Two LEDs (Green and Red) and two 7-segment displays (HEX_1, HEX_2) provide status information.

üö¶ Finite State Machine (FSM)
The system is implemented as a Moore FSM with the following states:

State	Name	Binary	Description	LED Output	HEX Output (HEX_1, HEX_2)
1	IDLE	3 
‚Ä≤
 b000	Waiting for a car at the entrance sensor.	OFF, OFF	OFF, OFF
2	WAIT_PASSWORD	3 
‚Ä≤
 b001	Car detected; waiting for password input.	RED ON	E, n
3	WRONG_PASS	3 
‚Ä≤
 b010	Incorrect password entered.	RED Blinking	E, E
4	RIGHT_PASS	3 
‚Ä≤
 b011	Correct password entered; access granted.	GREEN Blinking	6, 0
5	STOP	3 
‚Ä≤
 b100	Car stopped inside (both entrance/exit sensors high). Requires re-entry of correct password to clear.	RED Blinking	5, P

üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details
Language: Verilog HDL

FSM Type: Moore FSM

Password: The correct password is fixed in the code: password_1=2 
‚Ä≤
 b01, password_2=2 
‚Ä≤
 b10.

Time Out: A simple counter (counter_wait) is used to enforce a brief window (when counter_wait ‚â§3 clock cycles) in the WAIT_PASSWORD state before checking the password.

Blinking: LED blinking is implemented by toggling the temporary LED register (red_tmp, green_tmp) on every positive clock edge in the relevant states.
